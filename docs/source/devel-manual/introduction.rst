Introduction
============

|GNATdashboard| provides an API to access the collected results, and several
reporters/exporters.

HTML Report
-----------

This reporter generates a standalone web application that any web server can run
(e.g.  Python's SimpleHTTPServer implementation).

JSON Report
-----------

This format aims at providing an structured output for a tool to consume. It
uses the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to encode the collected data.
