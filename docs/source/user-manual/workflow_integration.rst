Integrating |GNATdashboard| into your workflow
==============================================

|GNATdashboard| provides an integration with the |SonarSource|
software. |SonarQube| is an open platform to manage code quality. It is
extensible with plug-ins to add support for new languages and rules.

The |SonarAdaPlugin| provided with |GNATdashboard| packages supports
|SonarQube| platform for the LTS (long-term support) version (currently
|SonarQubeLTSVersion|).

How |GNAThub| integrates with |SonarQube|
-----------------------------------------

Sonar Ada Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|SonarScanner| requires a |SonarQube| Ada plug-in to work on Ada sources.
|SonarAdaPlugin| is provided to this effect and is part of the |GNATdashboard|
package. It is configured to read the |SQLite| database populated by |GNAThub|
and its plug-ins (it reads its configuration in :file:`sonar-project.properties`
generated by |GNAThub| :program:`sonar-config` plug-in).

To use it in the context of |GNATdashboard|, first deploy |SonarAdaPlugin| into
your |SonarQube| instance (please refer to |SonarQube| manual for plug-ins
installation).

|SonarScanner|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|GNAThub| execution (see :ref:`getting-started`) generates one |SonarScanner|
configuration file :file:`sonar-project.properties` describing the project being
analyzed (project name, project key, location of the :file:`gnathub.db` file,
...). This is fully generated by the :program:`sonar-config` plug-in of
|GNAThub| and is expected to be used *as-is* by the |SonarAdaPlugin| part of the
|GNATdashboard| product.

|GNAThub| :program:`sonar-config` plug-in regenerates the :file:`sonar-project.properties`
configuration file each time it is executed. This file is a project configuration
file and does not contain authentication credentials in it. In order to authenticate,
these parameters could be passed explicitly when the :program:`sonar-scanner` plug-in is
executed through :command:`--targs:` switch tool specific parameters, *eg.*::

    $ gnathub -P project --plugins sonar-scanner --incremental
           --targs:sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=<project_key>
	   -Dsonar.login=<sonar_login> -Dsonar.password=<sonar-password>

|SonarScanner| reads its settings from two different files:

* the system-wide :file:`$SONAR_RUNNER_HOME/conf/sonar-scanner.properties`
* the project-specific :file:`sonar-project.properties` file provided through
  the :option:`-Dproject.settings` command line argument of |SonarScanner|

See `Analyzing with SonarQube Scanner <http://bit.ly/2g1Fnnx>`_ for more
information on |SonarScanner|.

By default, |GNAThub| will create the |SonarScanner| configuration file, and
launch the |SonarScanner| itself.

This execution is handled by the :program:`sonar-scanner`
plug-in of |GNAThub|. This is always scheduled as the last |GNAThub| plugin:
this ensures that the output of all other tools is available in
the |GNAThub| database and that :file:`sonar-project.properties` has
been generated prior to launching the |SonarScanner|.

.. note::

    |GNAThub| expects :program:`sonar-scanner` or :program:`sonar-scanner.bat`
    to be available on the :envvar:`$PATH`.

|GNATdashboard| without |SonarQube|
-----------------------------------

|SonarQube| is only used to display results from various analyses.
The technical debt information is also available in the |SonarQube| dashboard
for the issues reported by the supported tools. It is therefore not mandatory
to display the analysis: for instance, you can choose not to use the |SonarQube|
integration but use custom scripting to extract the analysis results stored in
the |GNAThub| database.

To disable the :program:`sonar-config` and :program:`sonar-scanner` plug-ins,
use the :command:`Plugins_Off` project attribute
(see :ref:`project-attr-plugins-off`).

Incremental analysis
--------------------

|GNAThub| can be configured to run one plug-in at a time and thus provides
incremental execution of each plug-in (allowing for finer grain control and
better integration in existing project and code base).

Use :ref:`gnathub-switch-incremental` to enable incremental mode::

  $ for plugin in gnatcheck gnatmetric codepeer; do
  >   gnathub --incremental --plugins $plugin -P project.gpr
  > done

  $ gnathub --incremental --plugins sonar-config -P project.gpr
  $ gnathub --incremental --plugins sonar-scanner -P project.gpr

If you do not wish to use the |SonarQube| integration, you can
simply omit the last two |GNAThub| executions and use the
:ref:`gnathub-switch-exec` switch for custom database processing::

  $ gnathub --exec my-results-collector.py -P project.gpr
